# UnexpectedFactorial
Inspired by the community of [r/unexpectedfactorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedfactorial/hot/), this program takes in text, and evaluates any and all factorials (unexpected or not) and gives you the result.

> When you put an '!' next to a number, it makes it look like a factorial. Sometimes people do this on accident, as you can see in all the posts in the sub."

For example, if you said: "Lets meet at 6!", that would evaluate to "Lets meet at 720."
This program simplifies your life by evaluating all the factorials so you don't have to.

## Running the program
If you don't have NetBeans and or don't know what NetBeans is, download this repository, and unzip `UnexpectedFactorial.zip`.
Once you have done this, find `Text.txt`. If there isn't one, run `UnexpectedFactorial.jar`, and it will create one for you. Inside `Text.txt`, put in your text <sup>(wow, no duh)</sup>, save it, and run `UnexpectedFactorial.jar` again. The output will be saved in the <sup>(wait for it...)</sup> `output.txt` file. Have fun!

If you do have NetBeans, simply open the project inside NetBeans, and run `UnexpectedFactorial.java` from the src folder. It can take input from either `Text.txt`, or System.in, with `Text.txt` having first priority.
