# UnexpectedFactorial
Inspired by the community of [r/unexpectedfactorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedfactorial/top/), this program takes in text, and evaluates any and all factorials (unexpected or not) and gives you the result.
From r/unexpectedfactorial:
"What is the Sub?
It's a math joke. If you don't like math you can leave now. If you do, and want to learn about it, here you go.
When you put an '!' next to a number, it makes it look like a factorial. Sometimes people do this on accident, as you can see in all the posts in the sub."
For example, if you said: "Lets meet at 6!", that would evaluate to "Lets meet at 720."
This program simplifies your life by evaluating all the factorials so you don't have to.
